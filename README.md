## Abstract
Explaining variation in the fitness of organisms is a fundamental goal in evolutionary ecology. Maintenance energy metabolism is the minimum energy required to sustain biological processes at rest (resting metabolic rate; RMR) and is proposed to drive or constrain fitness of animals, however this remains debated. Hypotheses have been proposed as to why fitness might increase with RMR (the ‘increased intake’ or ‘performance’ hypothesis), decrease with RMR (the ‘compensation’ or ‘allocation’ hypothesis), or vary among species and environmental contexts (the ‘context dependent’ hypothesis). Here, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, finding 114 studies with 355 relationships between RMR and traits that may be related to fitness. We show that individuals with relatively high RMR generally have high fitness overall, which might be supported by an increased energy intake. However, fitness proxies are not interchangeable: the nature of the RMR-fitness relationship varied substantially depending on the specific trait in question, and we found no consistent relationship between RMR and those traits most closely linked with actual fitness (i.e., lifetime reproductive success). We hypothesise that maintaining high RMR is not costly when resources are unlimited, and we propose ideas for future studies to identify mechanisms underlying RMR-fitness relationships.
